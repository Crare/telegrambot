  "Good morning!",
  "Hyv채채 huomenta!",
  "Morning starts with coffee right?",
  "Sunbeams will soon smile through, good mornin', good mornin', to you",
  "Hyv채채 huomenta Suomi, hyvin pyyhkii, sun poikas valvoo taas ja ahkeroi",

  "It's a new great day ahead!",
  "Time to wake up! It's a great day ahead!",
  "Good morning, did you miss me?"
